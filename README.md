I created a user-friendly calculator app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app features a simple and intuitive interface, allowing users to perform basic arithmetic operations with ease. It is designed to be responsive and accessible, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices. The app also includes interactive buttons and real-time calculation results for a seamless user experience.
